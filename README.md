# paramperceptnet
Parametric enhancement of PerceptNet.

## Installation

We currently provide two requirements files: `requirements.txt` and `requirements_examples.txt`. The first one provides only the necessary libraries to use the model, while the second one provides the libraries to run all the examples in the `Examples/`  folder.

Choose the one you want to install and:

**1. Clone the repository**
```
git clone https://github.com/Jorgvt/paramperceptnet.git
cd paramperceptnet
```

**2. Install the requirements**
```
pip install -r requirements.txt # or requirements_examples.txt
```

## Pre-trained models

We have uploaded a couple of pre-trained models to HuggingFace:

1. Parametric Fully Trained: (https://huggingface.co/Jorgvt/ppnet-fully-trained)
2. Parametric Bio-Fitted: (https://huggingface.co/Jorgvt/ppnet-bio-fitted)

Instructions on how to load them can be found in their Model Card and in the examples provided in `./Examples/`.

## Examples

There are some notebook usage examples in the `./Examples/` folder.
